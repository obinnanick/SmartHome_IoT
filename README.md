# SmartHome_IoT
AWS IoT Smart Home Infrastructure using Terraform - Includes IoT Core, Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB for real-time device communication and data storage.
# AWS IoT Smart Home Project

This project implements a smart home IoT solution using AWS services. It includes real-time device communication, data processing, and secure storage.

## Architecture Overview

- **AWS IoT Core**: Manages communication between IoT devices and AWS services.
- **AWS Lambda**: Processes incoming device data.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Stores device state and metadata.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Exposes an API for smart home devices.
- **AWS IAM**: Manages permissions and security policies.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

The project is deployed using **Terraform**, ensuring reproducibility and easy management.

### Resources Defined:

1. **AWS IoT Core**: Defines an IoT thing and policy for communication.
2. **IoT Topic Rule**: Triggers a Lambda function when data is received.
3. **Lambda Function**: Processes device data.
4. **IAM Role**: Grants permissions to the Lambda function.
5. **API Gateway**: Enables external access to smart home data.
6. **DynamoDB Table**: Stores device data for querying.

## Deployment Steps

1. Install Terraform and AWS CLI.
2. Configure AWS credentials.
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the project.
4. Run `terraform apply` to deploy resources.
5. Upload the Lambda function zip file to S3 and update the function code.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with AWS S3**: Store images or videos captured by smart home devices.
- **AWS Kinesis Data Streams**: Implement real-time data streaming and analytics.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Analyze smart home data for predictive maintenance.
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Develop a user-friendly interface for controlling devices.
- **Enhanced Security Measures**: Implement encryption and role-based access controls.
- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Improve reliability by deploying across multiple AWS regions.
